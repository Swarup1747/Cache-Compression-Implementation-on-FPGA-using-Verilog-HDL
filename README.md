 This project presents the design and implementation of cache
 compression using Verilog, one of the efficient data storage strategies to
 maximize storage capacity.From the results we can assure that data is
 compressed and achieved in efficient manner.But it can be improved by
 the complex algorithms like LZ77/LZ78 Compression,Deflate,etc.
 Implementation on FPGA gives as the practical uses or real time uses.
 verilog-based cache implementations offer a flexible and customizable
 approach to improving overall system efficiency and speed
